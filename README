I only thought a very simple system to inject(plugins , wtf?) in all programs...

First, i found hook links in the dynamic library file, second i
try to retrieve with the hook_size function, and then i try to inject the
hooked function in the process memory...

But it doesn't work :(

Thanks again to shura for the script modcomp 
and the plugin management.
